# TRACK A — is the face-prompt crash LENGTH or WORDS?

**ANSWER: _(not yet established — run in progress)_**

Server: `127.0.0.1:18188` only. Nothing in this file touched 28191.
Graph: FROZEN. Every arm is an in-memory mutation of an already-submitted API
graph; `OFMTech-NSFW/OFMTech_NSFW.json` (`a811b5d6…`) was not edited.

## Method

### Where the arms branch from

Every arm below is a copy of `results/r4/R4_CF15_filled/api_graph.json` — the
**shipping** graph (`a811b5d6…`, `#114 bbox_crop_factor 1.5`) with the owner's
LoRAs loaded (`lunaskye` on `#618`, `luna` on `#116`), which crashed at
`622:403` on 2026-08-06 as `dd94393a`. Its clean twin,
`results/r4/R4_CF15_placeholder/api_graph.json`, differs from it in
`620:106.inputs.text` and nothing else.

### Tokenizer — the graph's own, and it is **not** the one the node label claims

`620:110 CLIPLoader` is set to `qwen.safetensors`, `type: lumina2`. **The
`lumina2` setting is not what decides the tokenizer.** `comfy/sd.py:1300`
dispatches on `detect_te_model(state_dict)` first and only uses `clip_type` as a
sub-discriminator. `qwen.safetensors` has
`model.layers.0.post_attention_layernorm.weight` shape `[2560]` **and**
`model.layers.0.self_attn.q_norm.weight`, which is `sd.py:1240` →
`TEModel.QWEN3_4B` → `sd.py:1382` → **`comfy.text_encoders.z_image.ZImageTokenizer`**
(a `Qwen2Tokenizer` over `comfy/text_encoders/qwen25_tokenizer`).

Two consequences, both measured not assumed:

* Token counts below are produced by instantiating that exact class offline.
* `Qwen3Tokenizer` is built with `max_length=99999999`, `pad_to_max_length=False`,
  `has_start_token=False`, `has_end_token=False`
  (`comfy/text_encoders/z_image.py:6-11`). **There is no 77-token limit and no
  truncation anywhere on this path.** 77 is a CLIP number and does not apply.
* `ZImageTokenizer` wraps every prompt in
  `<|im_start|>user\n{}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n`, which costs a fixed
  **8 tokens**. So `tokens = 8 + content tokens`; the empty string is 8.

Reference counts (measured):

| string | tokens |
|---|---|
| `""` (empty) | 8 |
| `luna, ` | 12 |
| `a woman's face` | 12 |
| `TRIGGER, PROMPT FOR YOUR MODEL` (shipped placeholder) | 16 |
| the known-crashing string | **46** |

### Ladder token counts (measured with the same tokenizer)

| words | tokens | prefix |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | — |
| 1 | 11 | `luna,` |
| 2 | 12 | `luna, a` |
| 3 | 13 | `luna, a young` |
| 4 | 14 | `luna, a young woman` |
| 5 | 15 | `… with` |
| 6 | 16 | `… light` |
| 7 | 19 | `… freckles` |
| 8 | 20 | `… across` |
| 10 | 22 | `… her nose` |
| 12 | 25 | `… and cheeks,` |
| 14 | 27 | `… natural skin` |
| 16 | 29 | `… texture with` |
| 20 | 35 | `… visible pores, detailed eyes,` |
| 24 | 45 | `… photorealistic portrait photograph, 85mm` |
| 25 | 46 | the full string |

The crashing string is 25 words. The brief's ladder asked for up to 32 words;
32 does not exist, so the top rung is 25.
